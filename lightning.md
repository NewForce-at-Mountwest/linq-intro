# Doin' it the hard way

Here's a list of the number of students in each cohort at NSS over the past year.
```
  List<int> cohortStudentCount = new List<int>()
            {
                25, 12, 28, 22, 11, 25, 27, 24, 19
            };
```

Using only a `foreach` loop and basic arithmetic:

1. Find the average number of students per cohort.
2. Find the total number of students who graduated in the past year.
3. How many students were in the biggest cohort?
4. How many students were in the smallest?
